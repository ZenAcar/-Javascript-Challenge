# UFO Sightings - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

* The live deployed webpage can be found here
[UFO Sightings](https://zenacar.github.io/UFO.github.io/)

A responsive web application to visualize the collection of all the reported UFO sightings using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and D3.js. The report data from the dataset is presented dynamically in a table format and users can filter the table data for specific values based on search criteria.


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, a table is dynamically appended to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Users can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
